				<h2>Our process</h2>

				<h3>Vet</h3>

				<p>
					Projects are vetted and accepted on a rolling basis based on
					scope, student-friendliness, and project flexibility.
				</p>

				<h3>Accept</h3>

				<p>
					Accepted projects are assigned a Project Manager - a local
					senior software engineer who has years of experience
					building real-world software projects for companies of all
					sizes.
				</p>

				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>
					Our Project Manager helps you create a well-defined scope of
					work specifically designed to enable students to be able
					deliver meaningful value to you and your customers.
				</p>

				<h3>Match</h3>

				<p>
					We then use our connections with local organizations such as
					Code Youngstown, YSU, and MCCTC to match your project
					students are ready to take their experience to the next
					level and are excited at the prospect of working on a
					project like yours.
				</p>

				<h3>Execute</h3>

				<p>
					Students execute the work transparently - expect weekly
					progress check-ins with your Project Manager and to have
					access to all outputs from day 1.

				<h2>What we don't do</h2>

				<h3>Brownfields</h3>
				<p>
					We believe that brownfield projects (projects that already
					exist) require a Project Manager who deeply understands the
					existing project to effectively guide and get the most out
					of a student. Instead we suggest hiring an intern directly,
					which we are happy to help with!
				</p>

				<h3>Give companies direct access to students</h3>
				<p>
					The Project Manager plays the important role of keeping the
					project within a scope executable by the student, which is
					an important part of making sure the project output is
					something that you can deliver to your users.
				</p>

				<h3>Lock you in</h3>
				<p>
					Our projects are built to be built upon. Everything we
					deliver is well-documented and built using the most popular
					open source technologies on the market today.
				</p>

				<h3>Not pay our students</h3>
				<p>
					All of our students are paid fairly by the hour as 1099
					contractors.
